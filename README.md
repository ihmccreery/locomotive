A few notes before we begin
---

I wonâ€™t be telling you when to check in changes to Git.  Figure it out yourself.  I recommend doing it often. 

The basics
---

Create an empty GitHub repository: <http://github.com/new>.

Clone it:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ihmccreery/locomotive.git

Initialize a Rails project:

    $ cd locomotive/
    $ rails new .

Change the README to Markdown:

    $ git rm README.rdoc
    $ touch README.md
